# Chinook_Moloud_Aram
Chinkook
Chinkook is the final project of my data analysis bootcamp, where I apply and showcase my skills in SQL, Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and Power BI. This project involves data collection, analysis, visualization, and reporting, demonstrating comprehensive knowledge and practical application in data science and analytics.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:

Analyze: Explore and analyze data using SQL and Python.
Visualize: Create meaningful visualizations using Power BI.
Document: Report findings and insights using Jupyter Notebooks.
Deliver: Develop a comprehensive analysis report and presentation.
Tools & Technologies Used
SQL: For data querying and manipulation.
Python: For data cleaning, analysis, and scripting.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data exploration and documentation.
Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
